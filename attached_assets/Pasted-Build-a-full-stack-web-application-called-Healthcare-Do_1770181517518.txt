Build a full-stack web application called:

"Healthcare Doctor–Patient Translation Web Application"

This is a time-constrained take-home assignment for a healthcare company. 
The goal is to demonstrate problem-solving, AI integration, and product thinking.
The app does NOT need to be perfect, but it must be functional, clear, and explainable.

---------------------------
CORE REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
---------------------------

1. ROLES
- Two roles: Doctor and Patient
- Each role can select their preferred language (English, Hindi, Spanish etc.)

2. TEXT CHAT WITH TRANSLATION
- A clean chat interface
- Messages typed by one role should be translated into the other role’s selected language
- Show:
  - Sender role (Doctor / Patient)
  - Original message
  - Translated message
  - Timestamp

3. AI TRANSLATION
- Use an AI / LLM based translation approach
- Structure the code cleanly so the AI logic is isolated in one place

4. CONVERSATION PERSISTENCE
- Messages should persist even after refresh
- Use a simple persistent store (local storage or lightweight backend)

5. CONVERSATION SEARCH
- Add a search input
- Allow searching keywords across past messages
- Highlight matched text and show surrounding context

6. AI-POWERED SUMMARY
- Add a “Generate Summary” button
- Use AI to generate a concise medical summary
- Try to extract:
  - Symptoms
  - Diagnoses
  - Medications
  - Follow-up actions
- Display the summary in a separate panel or modal

---------------------------
OPTIONAL (DO NOT BLOCK CORE)
---------------------------
- Audio recording and playback (if time allows)
- If partially implemented, leave clear TODO comments

---------------------------
TECHNICAL GUIDELINES
---------------------------
- Use a modern frontend framework (React preferred)
- Mobile-friendly UI
- Keep code clean, readable, and well-commented
- Avoid over-engineering
- Use sensible defaults

---------------------------
DEPLOYMENT
---------------------------
- The application must be deployed publicly
- Use Replit deployment or a free hosting option
- Handle environment variables properly
- Do NOT hardcode API keys

---------------------------
DOCUMENTATION (IMPORTANT)
---------------------------
Generate a professional README.md that includes:
- Project overview
- Features implemented
- Tech stack used
- AI tools used
- Trade-offs and limitations
- What would be improved with more time

The README should sound honest and engineer-written, not marketing content.

---------------------------
QUALITY BAR
---------------------------
- The project should look like it was built by a real engineer
- Prioritize correctness and clarity over polish
- If something is simplified due to time constraints, explain it clearly
